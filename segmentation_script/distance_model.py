#### 2- Loading of the different models configurations 
"""
This part is for loading the different model configurations and their weights. There are three possible configurations  :
1. Model Pixel : takes an input_size of 1 + 2 layers of 64 hidden neurons , trained on single pixel's intensity vectors
2. Model Patch : takes an input_size of 9 + 2 layers of 64 hidden neurons , trained on pixel and 8-closest neighbors intensity vectors
3. Model Distance :  takes an input_size of 2 + 2 layers of 64 hidden neurons , trained on single pixel's intensity vectors and a distance map
associated to the serie. To be used, it needs at least one reference segmentation for the image serie which is
often the segmentation of the last image.
